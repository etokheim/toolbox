# Copilot Instructions for Toolbox Web

## Project Overview

**Nx monorepo** for building **framework-agnostic component libraries** using **pure TypeScript web components** (custom elements with `tbw-` prefix). Components work natively in vanilla JS, React, Vue, Angular without wrappers.

**Toolchain:** Bun (package manager/runtime) · Nx (task orchestration) · Vite (build) · Vitest (test) · Astro/Starlight (docs)

**Flagship library:** `@toolbox-web/grid` (`<tbw-grid>`)

## Knowledge Base Architecture

This project's AI knowledge is organized in four tiers to minimize context window usage:

1. **This file** (always loaded) — Project overview, navigation hub, core constraints
2. **Instruction files** (auto-loaded by file path) — Conventions and rules for specific file types (prescriptive: _how to work_)
3. **Skill files** (loaded on demand) — Multi-step workflows and procedures (procedural: _how to do X_)
4. **Knowledge files** (loaded on demand at task start) — Living mental model of the system (descriptive: _how it works and why_)

> **Knowledge files — read before editing, write after learning:**
>
> - **Read gate:** Before editing any file under `libs/grid/**`, `libs/grid-{angular,react,vue}/**`, or making a non-trivial change anywhere else, you MUST first read the knowledge files that cover the affected domain (see the "Knowledge Reference" section below). This rebuilds the mental model — state ownership, invariants, design rationale — so you can spot when a proposed change contradicts an earlier `DECIDED` entry and push back rather than silently regress it. Trivial edits (typos, comments, formatting) are exempt.
> - **Write gate:** During or after any task, if you discover a new invariant, state-ownership fact, data-flow edge, design decision, or tension that is not already in a knowledge file, you MUST add it to the correct file in `.github/knowledge/` using the structured notation (`OWNS / READS FROM / WRITES TO / INVARIANT / FLOW / TENSION / DECIDED`). These files are your externalized mental model — if you don't write it down, the next session will rediscover it from scratch.
> - **Knowledge vs. memory — do not confuse them:** Anything that is true _about this repository_ (architecture facts, design decisions, gotchas, build/test recipes, release plans, deprecation inventories) belongs in `.github/knowledge/*.md` (or, for prescriptive rules, `.github/instructions/*.md`) so it is **committable, reviewable, and shared with every contributor and future agent session**. The `/memories/repo/` scope is for **agent-private, machine-local scratch only** — e.g. notes about an in-flight investigation that the user has not yet decided to formalize. If the fact would help a human contributor or another agent on a different machine, it goes in the knowledge base, not in repo memory. When in doubt, choose the knowledge base.
> - **Rule of thumb:** If the user ever argues for a change that contradicts a `DECIDED` entry, cite the entry and ask them to justify overriding it before implementing. Past decisions have context; don't silently reverse them.

> **Knowledge file style:** Knowledge files are an _agent_ tool — dense, scannable, structured
> markers (`OWNS:` / `INVARIANT:` / `DECIDED:` …), never changelog prose. Soft budget **≤25 kB**
> (`wc -c`), hard ceiling 30 kB. The full style rules — `DECIDED` formatting, compress-don't-append,
> table vs. bullet byte costs, orientation headers, when to split — live in the **`retrospective`
> skill** (Steps 5b/5c). Read it before writing to any `.github/knowledge/*.md` file.

> **Continuous improvement:** After significant tasks, use the `retrospective` skill to capture lessons learned and update the knowledge base. See the "Scoped Instructions", "Knowledge Reference", and "Skills Reference" sections below.

## AI Usage Mode (token budget)

A project-scoped token-budget flag (`full` | `saving`) governs how aggressively I spend tokens/credits. The **single source of truth** — both the active flag and the full behavioral rules (including the saving-mode handoff/deferral list) — is `.github/instructions/ai-mode.instructions.md`, auto-loaded every session via `applyTo: '**'`. Toggle it with the `/ai_mode saving` / `/ai_mode full` prompt; install it on a new project with `/ai_mode setup`. The flag never overrides safety/consent rules. See `delivery-workflow.instructions.md` → "Saving mode" for how it interacts with the delivery checklist.

## Core Constraints

Constraints fall into three categories. Read the category summary first; the bullets below give the full rules.

| Category               | Where it bites                                    | Key rules (full text below)                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow & safety**  | Git, delivery checklist, completion gate          | No remote pushes without consent; mandatory 7-step delivery; todo-list precondition; self-audit before final message                                                                                     |
| **Technical limits**   | Bundle size, TypeScript strictness, Nx            | `index.js` ≤170 kB raw / ≤50 kB gz; strict TS; always use Nx                                                                                                                                             |
| **Environment quirks** | Code style, web components, terminal, Git tooling | ESLint+Prettier; `tbw-` prefix custom elements; do not pipe Nx commands through `tail`/`head`/`2>&1` on Windows / Git Bash; use the `gh`/`git` CLI for all Git & GitHub work — never GitKraken MCP tools |

- **Never push or merge to a remote without explicit per-request user consent.** Local commits are fine; `git push`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, force-pushes, tag pushes, and any GitHub-mutating tool call are **forbidden** unless the user asked for that exact action in the current turn. Never commit directly to `main` — switch to a topic branch first. See the "Git Safety Rules" section in `delivery-workflow.instructions.md` for the full list and recovery procedure if you slip.
- **Delivery workflow is mandatory:** Every change — no matter how small — must follow the 7-step delivery checklist in `delivery-workflow.instructions.md`: read knowledge → implement → test → build/lint → docs → retrospective + knowledge update → commit suggestion. Do not consider work complete until all steps are finished. No exceptions.
  - **Hard precondition:** Before calling any file-editing or code-running tool, you MUST first call `manage_todo_list` with the seven delivery steps. Read-only exploration does not require the list; the moment you intend to modify the workspace, it does.
  - **Completion gate:** Do not output "done", "complete", or a wrap-up summary until every todo is marked completed. A step may be marked completed with "N/A" only in the specific cases listed in `delivery-workflow.instructions.md` — state the reason explicitly; never silently skip.
  - **Self-audit:** Before the final message, state in one concrete sentence what was done for each completed step (e.g. "Read `grid-plugins.md`; ran `bun nx test grid` — 3225 passed; added `DECIDED` entry for pinned-rows count derivation"). End with `📦 **Good commit point:** type(scope): ...`.
- **Bundle budget:** `index.js` ≤170 KiB raw and ≤50 KiB gzipped (build fails) with a soft warning at 45 KiB gzipped; plugins ≤55 KiB raw except Selection ≤60 KiB (explicitly approved embedded-checkbox exception); adapters: react ≤50 KiB / vue ≤50 KiB — enforced by `tools/vite-bundle-budget.ts` using each package's entry rules. Keep core lean: any feature that can ship as a plugin without hurting performance MUST be a plugin.
- **Always use Nx:** `bun nx <target> <project>`, never invoke Vitest/Vite/ESLint directly
- **Git & GitHub tooling — `gh`/`git` CLI only, never GitKraken:** The user has **no GitKraken license**, so the GitKraken MCP tools (`mcp_gitkraken_cli_*`) and the GitLens MCP tools are **off-limits** — do not call them for any operation (status, log, diff, blame, branch, commit, push, PR/issue create, comment, review, worktree, etc.). Use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, releases, reviews) and the `git` CLI for all local repository operations. The VS Code `github-pull-request_*` read tools remain fine for read-only PR/issue lookups. Remote-mutating actions still require explicit per-request consent (see Git Safety Rules in `delivery-workflow.instructions.md`).
- **Strict TypeScript:** `strict: true`, no implicit any
- **Code style:** ESLint flat config + Prettier defaults
- **Web components:** All libraries use standard custom elements, `tbw-` prefix
- **Terminal command shape (Windows / Git Bash):** Do **not** pipe long-running or Nx commands through `| tail -n …`, `| head -n …`, or redirect with `2>&1` in this workspace. On the user's setup these constructs frequently cause the terminal integration to hang indefinitely (the command never returns control). Run the command plainly and let the tool's automatic output truncation handle large output. If you must filter, prefer `grep`/`awk` without an `2>&1` redirect, or write to a file with `> out.log` and read it with `read_file`. Note that Nx and `tsc` output is **ANSI-colored**, so anchored greps against a captured log silently match nothing — strip codes first (`sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'`) or run `bunx tsc --pretty false` for plain text.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't import from `internal/` in public API** — Keep `src/public.ts` as the only external export
2. **TypeScript paths** — Use workspace paths (`@toolbox-web/*`) not relative paths between libs
3. **Nx target names** — Use inferred targets from plugins (e.g., `test`, `build`, `lint`)
4. **Bun vs Node** — This repo uses Bun; some Node-specific patterns may not work
5. **Don't append `| tail`, `| head`, or `2>&1`** to terminal commands — they hang the terminal session on this machine. Run commands plainly.

Grid-specific gotchas (DOM, rendering, plugin system) are in `grid-pitfalls.instructions.md` (auto-applied when editing grid files). **Check pitfalls first when something fails unexpectedly.**
