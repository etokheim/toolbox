# Run E2E Suites

Two Playwright e2e suites exist. This skill is the **runbook** — how to execute them and manage servers/baselines. For how to _write_ e2e tests (conventions, utilities, selectors, wait strategies), see the auto-applied `e2e-testing` instruction.

| Suite               | Location         | Purpose                                                            | Server                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Docs demos**      | `apps/docs-e2e/` | Every Astro demo page renders and works correctly                  | Auto-starts Astro on port 4450 |
| **Cross-framework** | `e2e/`           | Visual/functional parity across Vanilla, React, Angular, Vue demos | Manual server start required   |

## Docs demo tests

Auto-starts the Astro dev server — no manual setup:

```bash
bun nx e2e docs-e2e
```

## Promo recording (`@promo`)

The `@promo` tests in `apps/docs-e2e/tests/promo/` are **normal CI tests** that also double as
the source clips for the promo video. They run as part of `bun nx e2e docs-e2e` at full speed;
the promo config only layers on the visual/pacing extras.

```bash
bun run promo            # → nx run docs-e2e:e2e:promo
PROMO_HEADLESS=1 bun run promo   # no visible window; the reliable way to record
```

What the promo config changes (`apps/docs-e2e/playwright.promo.config.ts`):

| Setting                              | Why                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `process.env.PW_PROMO_OVERLAY = '1'` | Set in the config, not a shell prefix, so Git Bash / cmd.exe / Nx all behave       |
| `grep: /@promo/`, `workers: 1`       | Scenes record in declaration order so clips can be stitched                        |
| `video.size` **equal to** `viewport` | See below — a larger `video.size` does not upscale, it letterboxes                 |
| `viewport: 1592x720` (`1280 + 312`)  | The 312px control rail is parked in the overhang and cropped by the stitcher       |
| headed by default                    | The run is meant to be watched; `PROMO_HEADLESS=1` forces headless                 |
| `slowMo: 60`                         | Also the frame time for `glidePointer()`; scene pacing lives in `beat()` / `say()` |
| `astro build && astro preview`       | Records the built site — no HMR client, no dev overlay, minified assets            |

> **`video.size` must equal the viewport.** Playwright does not scale the screencast up to a
> larger `video.size` — it pastes the captured frame into the top-left of the bigger canvas and
> leaves the rest grey. `deviceScaleFactor` does not change this. Record at the viewport size and
> let the stitcher upscale to 1080p.

> **The delivered frame is 1280 wide, the recording is 1592.** The demo control rail has to stay
> clickable, so it is parked in a 312px overhang instead of being hidden, and `RAIL_PX` in
> `tools/stitch-promo.ts` crops it away before the scale/pad. Changing one of the three numbers
> (config `RAIL`, the stage `padding-right` in `overlay.ts`, stitcher `RAIL_PX`) without the other
> two either leaks the rail into the frame or clips the grid.

Clips land in `apps/docs-e2e/promo-output/<test>/video.webm` — one per test.

> Video clips are large. Do not commit `promo-output/`.

### Stitching the clips into one video

```bash
bun run promo:stitch     # → promo-output/promo-reel.mp4  (whatever promo-cut.json says)
bun run promo:full       # → promo-output/promo-full.mp4  (every scene, untrimmed)
bun run promo:init       # re-derive promo-cut.json from the recording — DISCARDS the edit
```

The reel is **not** the recording concatenated, and it is **not** computed. It is assembled from
`apps/docs-e2e/promo-cut.json`, a checked-in edit list:

```jsonc
{
  "sequence": [
    { "scene": "Selection modes", "in": 12.4, "out": 18.15, "note": "Range selection" },
    { "scene": "Column filtering", "in": 8.46, "out": 12.39, "note": "…", "skip": true },
  ],
}
```

Each entry is "play this scene's recording from `in` to `out` seconds"; array order is playback
order. `scene` is the **test title** minus ` @promo` (Playwright hashes the output directory names,
so titles are the only stable handle). Cards and feature clips are the same kind of entry — a card
is just a window of the hero recording.

**Retiming, reordering or dropping a shot is a JSON edit and needs no re-record.** Iterating is
`edit promo-cut.json` → `bun run promo:stitch` → watch. The one thing the JSON cannot do is extend
a shot past the window its `clip()` filmed; that needs a bigger `holdMs` and a new recording.

The file is derived on first run from the recorded `clip()` marks (cards first, features in
declaration order, punch and outro last, `reel: false` pre-`skip`ped). After that the JSON wins.
`--init` regenerates it and **throws the current edit away** — it is destructive by design.

`--xfade=<seconds>` overrides the 0.3 s dissolve; `--xfade=0` gives hard cuts.

### Reviewing the result

A reel is faster to review as a contact sheet than as a video:

```bash
cd apps/docs-e2e/promo-output
ffmpeg -y -v error -i promo-reel.mp4 -vf "fps=1,scale=440:-1,tile=7x7" -frames:v 1 ../../../tmp/reel-sheet.png
ffmpeg -y -v error -ss 17.9 -i promo-reel.mp4 -frames:v 1 ../../../tmp/frame.png   # one full-res frame
```

What to look for: every tile filled edge to edge (grey bands mean the `video.size` trap above), the
grid centred with dark margins, and each tile's caption matching what the frame actually shows — a
caption from the _next_ beat means the clip anchoring drifted, see `TAIL_S` in the stitcher.

Requires ffmpeg, which is **not** a project dependency. The script looks at `$FFMPEG`, then `PATH`,
then the winget install location (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/Microsoft/WinGet/Packages/Gyan.FFmpeg*/*/bin`
— winget does not put it on the PATH of already-open shells), then `node_modules/ffmpeg-static`.
Install with `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` or `bun add -d ffmpeg-static`. Without it the script still
prints the ordered clip list and exits 1.

**"http://localhost:4450 is already used"** — Astro 7's `astro dev` daemonizes itself when it
detects an AI-agent environment (`am-i-vibing`: `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode` **and** `GIT_PAGER=cat`, which
every VS Code integrated terminal sets), so a previous run could leave a daemon holding the port.
Both `docs-e2e:serve` and the Playwright `webServer` now clear `GIT_PAGER` to force the foreground
path, but a daemon started before that fix (or by a bare `bunx astro dev`) still needs stopping.
The promo config deliberately refuses to reuse a dev server, because recording against one would
capture the HMR client. Stop the daemon and re-run:

```bash
cd apps/docs-e2e && bunx astro dev stop
```

## Cross-framework tests

Demo servers must be running first (these tests do **not** auto-start servers).

```bash
# Option 1: start the 4 demo servers in a separate terminal, then run tests
bun run demo              # vanilla=4000, react=4300, angular=4200, vue=4100
bun nx e2e e2e            # run tests against the running servers

# Option 2: build + start dist servers + wait for ports + test (CI-friendly)
bun run e2e:full
```

If a run fails with connection-refused / timeout on ports 4000/4100/4200/4300, the demo servers aren't up — start them (Option 1) or use `e2e:full` (Option 2).

## Update visual baselines

Only after intentionally changing rendered output. Review the regenerated PNGs before committing.

```bash
bun nx e2e:update-snapshots e2e
```

`e2e/snapshots/` is **gitignored** — local baselines never leave your machine, because a
snapshot is only comparable to one captured on the same OS + Chrome build.

On CI the baseline comes from the Actions cache instead, driven by `TBW_VISUAL_MODE`:

| Context                   | Mode      | Behaviour                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| push to `main` / `2.x`    | `write`   | `updateSnapshots: 'changed'`, then saves the baseline cache |
| pull request              | `compare` | restores the newest trunk baseline and compares against it  |
| PR labelled `skip-visual` | `skip`    | bypasses all visual comparisons                             |

So a PR that intentionally changes rendering **will fail** the visual checks: inspect the
diff in the `playwright-report` artifact, then add the `skip-visual` label and **re-run the
job** (labelling alone does not re-trigger CI). The trunk run after merge overwrites the
baseline. Cache misses (first run, 7-day eviction, Chrome major bump) are graceful —
comparisons are skipped, not failed. Details: [e2e/README.md](../../../e2e/README.md) →
"Visual Baselines on CI".

## Performance-regression tests

Part of the regular `e2e` suite. Compares the **current build** against the **latest published release** (loaded from CDN) in the same browser session, so runner variance cancels out. Flags a regression if the current build is **>10% slower**; auto-retries up to 2× to absorb CI noise.

```bash
# Requires a build first (for the local UMD bundle)
bun nx build grid

# Run the self-comparison tests (no demo server needed)
bunx playwright test --config=e2e/playwright.config.ts performance-regression
```

| Env var            | Purpose                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PERF_CDN_VERSION` | Override CDN version to compare against (default: `latest`) |
| `PERF_RUN_ID`      | Unique ID for the output file (`perf-metrics-{runId}.json`) |

## Grid-stability tests

Structural assertions against the vanilla demo (virtualization bounds, zero JS errors, no memory/DOM leaks). Fast, deterministic, part of the regular `e2e` suite — no separate command needed.

| File                                       | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `e2e/tests/performance-regression.spec.ts` | Self-comparison benchmarks (no demo needed) |
| `e2e/tests/grid-stability.spec.ts`         | Structural stability tests (vanilla demo)   |
| `e2e/tests/perf-metrics-helper.ts`         | Metric accumulator + flush utility          |

## Diagnosing a CI failure

Both Playwright configs must keep the `['list']` and `['github']` reporters in their
CI reporter arrays. `github-summary-reporter.ts` writes **only** to
`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and prints nothing to stdout, so with it alone the job log
contains zero information about which test failed. `['github']` is what produces the
`::error file=…` annotation.

`bun run e2e` uses `--output-style=stream`; without it Nx buffers each task into a
collapsed `##[group]` and a failing task's output never reaches the log.

Retrieval recipe (Git Bash — write to a file, never pipe through `tail`/`head`):

```bash
gh run view <RUN_ID> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | select(.conclusion=="failure") | "\(.name) \(.databaseId)"'
gh api repos/OysteinAmundsen/toolbox/check-runs/<JOB_ID>/annotations --jq '.[] | "\(.path):\(.start_line) \(.message)"'
gh run view <RUN_ID> --job <JOB_ID> --log > tmp/ci.log   # then read_file the slice
gh run download <RUN_ID> -n playwright-report -D tmp/pw-report
```

The `playwright-report` artifact covers **both** suites (root `playwright-report/`
plus `apps/docs-e2e/playwright-report/` and both `test-results/` dirs) — keep all
four paths in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, otherwise a `docs-e2e` failure ships no
traces or screenshots.

For Vite `504 (Outdated Optimize Dep)` or stale dynamic-import URLs, inspect
`DEBUG=vite:deps` on a **fresh, isolated `vite.cacheDir`** while smoke and affected
demo tests run concurrently. Do not delete shared caches or filter console errors.
Prebundle imports identified by `new dependencies found` in the owning Astro
config; verify startup optimization finishes without later rediscovery. A
warm-cache rerun cannot establish that.

Artifact-only config wrappers can preserve the repo's configuration while changing
the cache and test port: use `.mts` for a Playwright wrapper importing ESM configs,
and pass Astro `--config` a path **relative to the Astro app root** (its resolver
uses `path.join(root, configFile)`, not absolute-path-aware `resolve`).
