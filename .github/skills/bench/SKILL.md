description: Run @toolbox-web benchmarks as local regression testing during development — either current-vs-previous-run (`bun run bench`) or current-vs-tag (the bundled bench-vs-tag.ts orchestrator). Covers writing `.bench.ts` files as part of issue development, running the suites, locating artifacts, and interpreting regressions. Use when implementing a perf-sensitive change, before opening a PR that touches hot paths, or when asked to benchmark.

# Benchmarking & Local Regression Testing

Benchmarks are the project's guard against silent performance regressions. Treat them like
unit tests for speed: write a `.bench.ts` when you add or change a hot path, and run the
suite to confirm a change didn't make things slower before you open a PR.

This skill backs the `/bench` slash command (`.github/prompts/bench.prompt.md`) but is also
meant to be invoked autonomously by agents during issue development. For _fixing_ a confirmed
regression, hand off to the `debug-perf` skill.

## When to write a `.bench.ts`

Add or extend a benchmark as an integral part of issue development whenever you:

- Touch a **hot path** — render scheduler, virtualization, config merge, sort/filter, plugin
  hook dispatch, large-dataset row building, adapter reconciliation.
- Add a **new feature or plugin** that runs work per-row, per-frame, or per-keystroke.
- Fix a **performance bug** — add a bench that would have caught it, so it can't silently return.

Bench files live next to the code under test as `*.bench.ts` and are picked up by each project's
`bench` target (`vitest bench`, `include: ['src/**/*.bench.ts']`). Keep each `bench()` case
focused on one operation; avoid mixing setup cost into the measured body (use the bench harness's
setup hooks only for immutable fixture construction). Mirror the style of existing benches under
`libs/*/src/**/*.bench.ts`.

### Stateful benchmark rules

- **Do not treat Tinybench `setup` as a per-invocation reset.** A stateful callback can become a
  cache hit or no-op after its first invocation. Restore or alternate the relevant state inside
  every timed invocation, and include that reset only when it is part of the operation being
  measured. If reset cost would contaminate the result, use prebuilt alternating fixtures.
- **Prove that every invocation performs real work.** Add a control case that exposes the expected
  algorithmic shape where practical, such as first/middle/last position updates.
- **Use deterministic fixtures.** Derive values and hit rates from indexes; never use
  `Math.random()` or `node:crypto` in fixture construction or timed callbacks. Current-vs-tag
  comparisons are meaningful only when both sides process the same data distribution.
- **Keep unrelated work outside the callback.** Prebuild rows, caches, and column definitions. If
  the operation under test requires invalidation, mutation, or cloning, include only the minimum
  reset that preserves a real operation on every invocation.

- **Validate the measured result, not the exit code.** Vitest can emit a benchmark entry without
  timings after an async callback fails. Require positive `sampleCount` and finite `mean` in JSON
  (`samples` may intentionally be empty). DOM benchmarks must assert actual mounted row/portal
  counts after scheduled rendering; a 30-child fixture can virtualize to two children in happy-dom.
- **Keep lifecycle hooks at file scope.** Vitest 4.1's benchmark runner recurses into nested suites
  without their `beforeAll`/`afterAll` hooks; uninitialized fixtures can produce timing-free JSON
  with exit 0. File-level hooks work. For rows replacement, `ready()` only awaits initial readiness:
  await the queued update and `forceLayout()`, then assert changed cell content on every invocation.
- **Match framework commit completion.** For paired control-renderer measurements, settle setup,
  await a commit marker for every live control each iteration, and counterbalance version order.
  Record ref bind/unbind, attribute mutations and mount counts outside timed samples to distinguish
  extra lifecycle work from process variance; keep the same fixture when validating a fix.

## Two ways to run

| Mode                        | Command                                                | Compares                                            | Use when                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Current vs previous run** | `bun run bench`                                        | HEAD now vs the last local bench output             | Iterating on a branch; quick "did my last edit slow this down?" |
| **Current vs tag**          | `bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts --ref <tag>` | HEAD vs a released tag, **same-runner** methodology | Validating a branch against a shipped baseline before a PR      |

`bun run bench` runs `nx run-many --target=bench` across the bench-enabled projects
(`grid`, `grid-react`, `grid-vue`) and writes per-project JSON to the bench output directory.

The `bench-vs-tag.ts` orchestrator materialises the baseline ref in a sibling git worktree,
runs `vitest bench` on **both** sides on this machine (same CPU / kernel / thermal state — the
whole point of the methodology), merges max-of-N per side via `tools/merge-bench-runs.ts`, and
compares via `tools/compare-benches.ts`. Artifacts land under `tmp/` (`bench-current-*.json`,
`bench-baseline-*.json`).

### bench-vs-tag flags (most useful)

```
bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts                    # default: last tag, all projects, 1 iter
bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts --ref grid-2.7.0   # explicit tag/SHA baseline
bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts --project grid     # subset (repeatable)
bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts --iterations 3     # max-of-N per side (noisy suites)
bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts --threshold 0.20   # tighter regression gate (default 0.30)
bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts --keep-worktree    # don't delete ../base on exit
bun .github/skills/bench/bench-vs-tag.ts --help             # full flag list
```

Run with `mode=sync` and a generous timeout — bench runs are long. Do **not** pipe through
`tail`/`head`/`2>&1` (terminal hangs on this machine — see `copilot-instructions.md`).

## Tag resolution

The user may pass a bare version like `2.7.0` instead of a fully-qualified tag. Resolve before
invoking `bench-vs-tag.ts`:

1. If the input is already a tag (`git rev-parse --verify "refs/tags/<input>"`), use it verbatim.
2. If it looks like semver (`^\d+\.\d+\.\d+`), prepend the flagship prefix `grid-` and re-check
   (`2.7.0` → `grid-2.7.0`).
3. Otherwise `git tag --list "*<input>*" --sort=-creatordate`. One match → use it. Multiple
   (e.g. `1.6.0` could be `grid-vue-1.6.0` or `grid-react-1.6.0`) → stop and ask; do not guess.
4. Nothing resolves → surface the failure and candidate list; do not fall back silently.

Echo the resolved tag back before starting (e.g. _"Resolved `2.7.0` → `grid-2.7.0`."_).

## Reading the results

Read the JSON / comparison-Markdown artifacts directly for precise numbers — do not parse console
output. For each suite compare current vs baseline mean and flag any regression above the script's
threshold (default `0.30` for vs-tag). When asked for a report, produce:

- **Check comparability before diagnosing a flagged row.** Diff the benchmark file and compare the
  Git blob hashes of the implementation and dependency lockfile against the baseline. If the
  implementation and lockfile are identical but fixture generation, lookup order, or measured work
  changed, classify the row as non-comparable benchmark drift rather than a code regression. Confirm
  with `--iterations 3`; do not optimize unchanged production code to compensate for fixture noise.

- **Isolate process variance on unchanged paths.** If repeated separate-process runs still flag
  unchanged code, temporarily measure baseline and candidate implementations with identical fixtures
  in one benchmark process. Preserve and report both results; a passing paired control does not erase
  the earlier flag. Remove the diagnostic imports/wrappers and verify the fixture has no diff.

- **Verdict** — one line: Faster / Slower / Mixed vs the named baseline, with the headline delta.
- **Per-suite table** — `Suite | Baseline mean | Current mean | Δ | Regression?`, sorted by |Δ%|.
- **Hotspots** — map each regressed suite to its `*.bench.ts` and the code under test; use
  `git log --oneline <baseline>..HEAD -- <path>` to surface suspect commits. For grid-core,
  cross-reference `.github/knowledge/grid-render-pipeline.md`, `.github/knowledge/grid-data-pipeline.md` and `.github/knowledge/data-flow-traces.md`.

If regressions exist, hand off to the `debug-perf` skill (profiling + fix) and the `/perf-fix`
prompt (execute one fix-plan item end-to-end).

## Constraints

- **Never push, never commit.** Benchmarking is read + analyze.
- Cite numbers; do not paraphrase deltas. Flag noisy-below-threshold suites explicitly.
- Do not "fix" the bench harness unless explicitly asked.
- Respect the bundle and perf invariants in `.github/knowledge/build-and-deploy.md`.
