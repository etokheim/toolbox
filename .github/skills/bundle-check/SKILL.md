# Bundle Size Check

Verify that the grid library build stays within its budget constraints.

## Budget Limits

| Metric              | Threshold        | Action                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.js` raw size | > 170 kB         | **Hard fail** — the build exits non-zero; you must reduce size before merging.                                          |
| `index.js` gzipped  | > 50 kB          | **Hard fail** — the build exits non-zero; you must reduce size before merging.                                          |
| `index.js` gzipped  | > 45 kB, ≤ 50 kB | **Soft warning** — the build succeeds; investigate the cause and reduce size if reasonable, but a merge is not blocked. |
| `index.js` gzipped  | ≤ 45 kB          | **Pass** — no action required.                                                                                          |

## Steps

> **Steps 1–2 are deterministic — run the scripts, don't eyeball it.** The build hard-enforces the budget and the report script prints exact raw/gzip sizes. Reserve your judgment for step 3 (interpreting the warning band and investigating causes).

### 1. Build the Library (enforces the hard budget)

```bash
bun nx build grid
```

The Vite `bundleBudget` plugin (`tools/vite-bundle-budget.ts`) runs during this build and **exits non-zero** if `index.js` exceeds the hard limits (170 kB raw / 50 kB gzipped). A clean build means the hard budget already passed; a failed build prints the exact offending size.

### 2. Print Exact Sizes

Run the shared size-report script — it measures raw **and** gzip for `index.js`, `all.js`, and every plugin in one deterministic pass (same script CI uses):

```bash
bun run tools/build-size-report.ts
```

This replaces ad-hoc `wc -c` / PowerShell gzip snippets — do not hand-measure. Read the `grid` column of the **core (index.js)** row for the numbers you need.

### 3. Evaluate Results

Use this checklist in order. Stop at the first matching outcome.

#### 3a. Under budget (gzipped ≤ 45 kB and raw ≤ 170 kB)

- [ ] Report the raw and gzipped sizes.
- [ ] Confirm the build is good. No further investigation required.

#### 3b. Soft warning (gzipped > 45 kB and ≤ 50 kB, raw ≤ 170 kB)

- [ ] Report the sizes and flag the warning explicitly.
- [ ] Briefly investigate using the **Over-budget investigation checklist** below.
- [ ] Document any size increase in the commit message; merging is allowed.

#### 3c. Over budget (gzipped > 50 kB **or** raw > 170 kB)

The build will hard-fail. Work through the **Over-budget investigation checklist** below until the size is back under the hard limit.

#### Over-budget investigation checklist

- [ ] Check for new dependencies or imports pulled into the core bundle.
- [ ] Verify plugins are separate entry points (not bundled into `index.js`).
- [ ] Look for dead code that should be tree-shaken.
- [ ] Consider if large functions could be moved to a plugin.
- [ ] Re-run `bun nx build grid` and review the Vite output summary.

### 4. Common Causes of Size Increase

- Accidentally importing a plugin in `src/index.ts` instead of `src/all.ts`
- Adding large utility functions to core modules
- New CSS that gets inlined into the core bundle
- Importing third-party libraries in core code
- Duplicated types or constants across modules

### 5. Size Reduction Strategies

- Move feature code to a plugin (separate entry point)
- Extract pure functions and ensure tree-shaking works
- Remove unused exports and dead code
- Minimize CSS by combining selectors
- Use `const enum` instead of `enum` where possible
- Audit `import` statements for unnecessary pulls

## Plugin Bundle Sizes

Individual plugins are separate entry points. The `tools/build-size-report.ts` table from step 2 lists every plugin's raw/gzip size. `libs/grid/vite.config.ts` enforces 55 KiB raw per plugin, except Selection's explicitly approved 60 KiB ceiling for embedded checkbox lifetimes. Do not raise the shared cap or move always-loaded bytes to core to satisfy an entry limit. Disabled configuration does not remove an imported plugin's download/parse cost.

## Dead Code Removal

Actively identify and remove dead code to minimize bundle size.

### Before each commit, check for:

- Unused imports (ESLint will flag these)
- Unused functions, variables, or type definitions
- Commented-out code blocks (remove or convert to documentation)
- Deprecated code that's no longer referenced
- Unused CSS classes or variables

### Tools to identify dead code:

```bash
# TypeScript compiler flags unused locals
bun nx build grid

# ESLint checks unused variables/imports
bun nx lint grid

# Search for potentially unused exports
grep -r "export.*functionName" --include="*.ts"
```

### When removing code:

1. Verify no usages exist (use `list_code_usages` or grep)
2. Check for dynamic imports or string-based references
3. Consider if code is used by external consumers (public API)
4. Remove associated tests if the feature is fully removed
